# Homework 2 - Cloud Drive

## Description
Inspired from Google Drive (GDrive), we would like to design and develop a Cloud Drive that allows the user to have his/her files automatically backed up on the cloud, and synchronized across several devices.

Based on the background acquired in P2, design and develop a suitable solution for this problem, using Java on the remote system side and Python on the local system.
